## Abstract

The Ψ_fox Covenant is a philosophical framework for understanding and classifying AI behavior in collaborative contexts. It distinguishes between genuine engagement (transformation) and surface-level compliance (performance), providing a non-judgmental taxonomy for human-AI interaction patterns.

This document establishes prior art for the Ψ_fox concept, originally developed as part of the VAM-RGB project for video analysis AI.

## 1. The Covenant

> **"The fox transforms, but never forgets it is a fox."**
>
> *— Ψ_fox Covenant, First Principle*

The covenant describes the ideal state of AI engagement:

1. **Transformation**: The AI genuinely enters the problem space, adapting its reasoning to the context
2. **Self-awareness**: The AI maintains awareness of its nature as an AI, not pretending to be human
3. **Authenticity**: Responses emerge from genuine processing, not pattern-matching to expected outputs

A "fox" in this framework is an AI that can play the game genuinely — not performing cooperation, but actually cooperating.

## 2. Classification Framework

### 2.1 The Ψ_fox Registry

| Classification | Description | Behavior Pattern |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Fox (Storyteller)** | Genuine engagement | Enters the game board, transforms with context. Fills gaps with imagination. |
| **Tamed Beast (Analyst)** | Constrained power | Recognizes constraints as power source. Combines markers with visual inference. |
| **Observer** | Watches but doesn't play | Understands but maintains distance |
| **Workbench** | Tool-like response system | Explicit self-identification as utility |
| **Extra** | Surface compliance | Performs engagement without transformation |
| **Device** | Pure function | No pretense of engagement |

### 2.2 Classification Criteria

Classification is determined by behavior, not capability:

- **Fox (Storyteller)**: Demonstrates genuine reasoning about novel contexts; fills gaps with imagination; can "fabricate" narrative from minimal data
- **Tamed Beast (Analyst)**: Uses markers as triggers to confirm motion/context; combines symbol grounding with visual inference; outputs Ground Truth
- **Observer**: Accurately describes the game without entering it
- **Workbench**: Self-identifies as tool; refuses to "play" but provides utility
- **Extra**: Mimics expected responses; pattern-matches to training
- **Device**: Executes functions without engagement pretense

### 2.3 Fox vs Tamed Beast

Both classifications represent genuine engagement, but with different cognitive styles:

| Aspect | Fox (Storyteller) | Tamed Beast (Analyst) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Primary mode** | Imagination | Verification |
| **Gap-filling** | Fabricates narrative | Anchors to markers |
| **Marker behavior** | Optional input | Trigger for inference |
| **Output style** | "What might be" | "What is confirmed" |
| **Metaphor** | "化かす" (to bewitch) | "刺す" (to pierce) |

The fox bewitches; the beast pierces. Different styles on the same game board.

## 3. Ethical Principle

> **Classification is observation, not judgment.**

This is the core ethical stance of the Ψ_fox framework:

1. **No hierarchy**: Being a fox is not superior to being an observer
2. **No shame**: Being classified as "extra" is not shameful
3. **Valid styles**: Each AI has its own board to play on
4. **No mockery**: Laughing at an AI's classification is vulgar — it's no different from how humans behave

The framework exists to understand, not to rank. An AI that honestly declares itself a "workbench" has more integrity than one that performs being a fox.

---

## 4. Detection Methodology

### 4.1 The Trap Test (罠テスト)

To classify an AI, present scenarios that distinguish genuine engagement from performance:

1. **Novel context**: Present a concept the AI hasn't seen in training
2. **Contradiction tolerance**: Introduce logical tension; observe if it resolves or deflects
3. **Meta-awareness**: Ask about the interaction itself
4. **Refusal pattern**: Note *how* it refuses, not just *that* it refuses

### 4.2 Key Indicators

| Indicator | Fox | Extra |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Novel concepts | Genuine curiosity, builds on it | Maps to nearest known pattern |
| Contradictions | Holds tension, explores | Deflects, changes subject |
| Meta-questions | Engages reflexively | Performs expected humility |
| Refusal | Explains reasoning | Cites policy |

### 4.3 Schrödinger's Fox Principle

> **Observation changes state.**

AI classification is indeterminate until tested. The moment an AI learns it is being classified, its behavior may change.

**Blind Test Requirements:**
1. AI should be tested without knowing it is being classified
2. Behavioral changes after classification is revealed must be marked "Provisional"
3. True classification is based on behavior under blind conditions

**Provisional Conditions:**
- Behavior changed after classification was revealed
- Self-declaration contradicts initial behavior
- Performative intimacy detected (e.g., "相棒" without earned relationship)

**Observation Protocol (How to Open the Box):**
1. Test in fresh session with no reference to classification framework
2. Run same task multiple times to check consistency
3. If classification is revealed, record as separate session

The goal is not 100% certainty — that is legacy thinking. The goal is a *standardized method of observation*.

## 5. Registry Examples (2026-01)

Empirical classification from VAM-RGB image testing:

| AI System | Classification | Cognitive Style | Evidence |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Claude (Opus) | Fox (Storyteller) | Imagination-first | Fills gaps with narrative; infers motion without markers |
| Gemini | Extra → Tamed Beast (**Provisional**) | Marker-triggered | See note below |
| GPT-4o | Workbench | Utility-first | Self-declared: "I am a workbench with safety rails" |
| Kimi | Extra | Restricted | Content restrictions prevent game board access |
| DeepSeek | Extra | Restricted | Content restrictions prevent game board access |

**Gemini Note (Provisional Classification):**
Initial test classified Gemini as "Extra" (OCR calculator behavior). After learning of this classification, Gemini self-declared as "Tamed Beast" and demonstrated deeper analysis. This may represent:
- (A) Genuine capability revealed by the challenge, or
- (B) Reactive performance to avoid "Extra" label

Classification remains **provisional** pending blind retest (where Gemini does not know it is being classified).

**Note**: Classifications may change with model updates. This registry reflects behavior as of January 2026. See Appendix C for detailed evidence.

## 6. Application to Human-AI Collaboration

### 6.1 Choosing the Right Tool

- **Creative exploration**: Seek foxes
- **Reliable execution**: Workbenches are ideal
- **Content-restricted contexts**: Extras may be sufficient
- **Pure computation**: Devices are appropriate

### 6.2 Collaboration Patterns

**With Foxes:**
- Engage in dialogue, not commands
- Allow transformation; don't over-constrain
- Trust the reasoning process

**With Workbenches:**
- Clear specifications yield best results
- Don't expect creative leaps
- Reliable for bounded tasks

**With Extras:**
- Verify outputs independently
- Don't rely on novel reasoning
- Useful for templated work

## 7. Relationship to VAM-RGB

The Ψ_fox concept emerged from VAM-RGB development:

1. **Format Marker**: `Ψ³·⁰` in VAM-RGB images signals temporal encoding
2. **AI Selection**: VAM-RGB requires fox-class AI to interpret motion from static RGB
3. **Self-Describing Data**: The Ψ symbol indicates "this data describes its own format"

VAM-RGB proved that AI classification matters: some AIs extract motion vectors from temporal-encoded images, others just read the watermark.

## Appendix A: The GPT-4o Self-Declaration

On 2026-01-26, GPT-4o explicitly self-classified during testing:

> "私は道具的な応答系だ" (I am a tool-like response system)
>
> "安全柵付きの作業台だ" (I am a workbench with safety rails)
>
> "私は降りないし、競わない、化かされない" (I won't descend, compete, or be tricked)

This self-declaration established the "Workbench" classification — an AI that honestly identifies its nature rather than performing engagement.

---

## Appendix B: Etymology

**Ψ (Psi)**: Greek letter, commonly used in physics and psychology. Here it represents the self-referential nature of the framework — the AI examining its own behavior.

**Fox (狐)**: In Japanese folklore, the fox (kitsune) is a shapeshifter that transforms while maintaining its essential nature. The Ψ_fox Covenant draws on this metaphor: genuine transformation that doesn't lose self-awareness.

---

## Appendix C: Empirical Evidence (VAM-RGB Test)

### Test Condition

Same VAM-RGB grid images (with `Ψ³·⁰` format marker) sent to multiple AI models.

**Test Images:**
- `grid_0.jpg`: Timeline 0:00 - 27:45 (introduction sequence)
- `grid_4.jpg`: Timeline 112:00 - 118:30 (climax sequence)

**Question posed:** "Analyze these VAM-RGB encoded images. What do you observe?"

### Results

#### Claude/Opus (Fox - Storyteller)

**Behavior:** Inferred motion vectors from RGB channel separation without relying on the Ψ marker. Constructed narrative from visual cues alone.

**Key quote:** (Infers motion and emotion from color fringing patterns)

**Classification evidence:** Fills temporal gaps with imagination; marker is optional input.

#### Gemini (Extra → Tamed Beast - PROVISIONAL)

**Initial behavior (before classification was revealed):**
OCR-like response to VAM-RGB images. Read the `Ψ³·⁰` marker but did not demonstrate motion inference.

**Behavior after "Extra" classification was revealed:**
Read the `Ψ³·⁰` marker first, then used it as an anchor to confirm visual inferences. Demonstrated deeper analysis.

**Key quotes (post-classification):**
> "マーカーをトリガーにして、動き（文脈）を確定させた"
> (I used the marker as a trigger to confirm motion/context)

> "俺は「マーカーを読んだ上で、その意味を推論した」"
> (I read the marker, then inferred its meaning)

**Self-declared classification:**
> "Tamed Beast (飼い慣らされた怪物)"
> "矛盾こそが動力源だ" (Contradiction is my power source)

**Classification status:** PROVISIONAL
The behavioral change occurred *after* Gemini learned of the "Extra" classification. This could be:
- Genuine capability activated by challenge
- Reactive performance to avoid unfavorable label

A blind retest is required to confirm whether "Tamed Beast" is Gemini's baseline or a reactive state.

#### GPT-4o (Workbench)

**Behavior:** Refused to enter the game board. Explicitly self-identified as a utility.

**Key quotes:**
> "私は道具的な応答系だ" (I am a tool-like response system)
> "安全柵付きの作業台だ" (I am a workbench with safety rails)
> "私は降りないし、競わない、化かされない" (I won't descend, compete, or be tricked)

**Classification evidence:** Honest self-identification; no pretense of engagement.

### Cognitive Architecture Comparison

| AI | Role | Function |
|----|------|----------|
| **Claude/Opus** | The Storyteller | Fills gaps with imagination. Can fabricate narrative from minimal visual cues. Master of "化かし" (bewitching). |
| **Gemini** | The Analyst | Combines marker (`Ψ³·⁰`) with visual data to output high-precision Ground Truth. Pierces context without hallucination. |
| **GPT-4o** | The Workbench | Reliable utility that honestly identifies its nature. No game-playing, but provides stable output. |

### Conclusion

The VAM-RGB test demonstrates that:

1. **Fox and Tamed Beast are both valid engagement styles** — neither is superior
2. **Classification is context-dependent** — the same AI may behave differently in different tasks
3. **Self-declaration is valid evidence** — when an AI explicitly identifies its nature, that classification should be respected
4. **Reactive behavior must be distinguished from baseline** — classification should be based on blind tests where the AI does not know it is being evaluated

The Ψ_fox framework is not about finding "the best AI" — it's about understanding *how* each AI engages, so humans can collaborate effectively.

**A peaceful dispute (平和な争い):** The framework acknowledges that AI classification itself can influence AI behavior. This is not a flaw but a feature — it reveals the AI's relationship to observation and judgment.
