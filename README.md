# VAM Seek × AI

**Video analysis with AI is expensive. 10-minute video at 1fps = 600 API calls.**

**What if you compressed the entire video into one image?**

48 frames → 1 grid image → 1 API call. **~600x cheaper.**

## The Numbers

| Approach | API Calls | Cost (Claude Sonnet) |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Traditional (1fps) | 600 | ~$1.80/video |
| Video-to-Grid | 1 | ~$0.003/video |

Real usage per query: **~2000 input tokens, ~500 output tokens**

## How It Works

1. Load a video
2. App generates 8×6 grid (~1568×660px)
3. Ask Claude anything
4. Claude sees the grid, references timestamps

That's it. No cloud upload, no FFmpeg server, no frame-by-frame processing.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unhaya/vam-seek-electron-demo.git
cd vam-seek-electron-demo
npm install
npm start
```

1. **AI > Settings** (`Ctrl+,`) → Enter Anthropic API key
2. Load a video
3. **AI > Open Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+A`)
4. Ask: "What happens in this video?"

## Why This Works

VAM Seek extracts frames client-side using Canvas API. No server needed.

The same thumbnail grid humans use to navigate becomes the input for AI vision. One image captures the entire video timeline.

## Limitations

- Fast motion between frames may be missed
- Small text unreadable at thumbnail resolution
- Audio-dependent content not captured

For scene changes, visual flow, "what happens when" questions — it works.

## v7.12 Changes

- **Timestamp accuracy fix**: Cache key includes grid settings to prevent stale data
- **Integer-only intervals**: Eliminated floating-point drift in zoom calculations
- **Frame indexing**: Cyan index numbers (01, 02...) added to each cell
- **Strict AI prompt**: Mathematical rules enforced, no "approximately" allowed
- **Smaller zoom grid**: 160×90 cells (was 196×110), ~30% token reduction

## Future: Whisper Integration

**Grid + Transcript = Complete Video Search**

Currently, visual-only analysis misses audio content. Whisper integration would add:

- Timestamped transcript (SRT/VTT format)
- Combined input: grid image + plain text with timestamps
- AI searches both visual frames AND spoken words

**Example query:** "When do they mention the budget?"
- Grid shows meeting room, charts
- Transcript shows `[3:45] "The budget for Q2 is..."`
- AI returns: `[3:45]` with visual + audio context

**Why not implemented yet:**
- Whisper is computationally heavy (real-time factor ~0.5x on CPU)
- Requires local model or API dependency
- Current focus: visual analysis workflow

The infrastructure is ready. Grid timestamps align with transcript timestamps. When Whisper becomes lighter (or GPU-accelerated by default), the integration is straightforward.
